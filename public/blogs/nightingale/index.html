<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>Gun control is one of the most hotly debated topics in the United States. There is a deep divide between those who consider it their Second Amendment right to bear arms, and those who believe the widespread posession of firearms is a threat to public health and safety. Here, we conceptualize two dominant risks posed by the widespread acceptance of firearms ownership in modern American society - suicide and homicide. In doing so, we are capable of identifying not only whether states with higher suicide rates are also prone to higher homicide rates, but also whether those with the highest rates share commonalities, such as state-level population size and, most importantly, proportion of firearm owners.</p>

<div id="the-data" class="section level1">

<div id="an-interpretation" class="section level1">
<h1>An Interpretation</h1>
<p>This data shows a number of complex relationships at play. The Spearman’s Rho indicates a relatively strong correlation between the White Suicide Rate and White Homicide Rate across all US states. Interestingly, this relationship does not seem to be well-explained by population, meaning that larger states do not seem particularly prone to high White Suicide or Homicide rates. This is demonstrated clearly by the presencer of states with 500,000 residents or less both in the middle of the cluster, with moderate homicide and suicide rates, and also at each extreme. Most notably, Alaska (AK) and New Mexico (NM) both have small populations, but both high suicide and homicide rates.</p>
<div id="occams-razor" class="section level2">
<h2>Occam’s Razor</h2>
<p>The simplest explanation is often the best. Here, while the rule is not without exception, we can see clearly that the darker datapoints are also those which, in general, experience both higher suicide and higher homicide rates than those which are less dark. In other words, states with higher gun ownership are also those with higher rates of white, non-hispanic male homicide and suicide. The obvious exceptions, such as Arizona and Nevada, do not invalidate this, though they do suggest that (as we would expect) higher homicide and suicide rates are not a function of gun ownership alone.</p>
<p>This provides compelling evidence in favour of the view that gun ownership and both homicide and suicide are strongly (and positively) related with one another. Regardless, entrenched traditions and gun lobbies, in addition to well-established bureaucracy and a less-than-progressive President, such evidence is repeatedly disregarded and discredited. As such, further research into the causal (rather than associational) relationships between gun ownership and firearms fatalities, and an awareness of what state-level factors condition this relationship, promises to be a critical catalyst for change.</p>
