<div id="the-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>The June 2016 Eropean Union (EU) Referendum, which resulted in a United Kingdom’s “Brexit” vote to leave the EU, was a significant turning point in international diplomacy. Understanding the potential drivers behind the United Kingsom’s decision, voting 52% to 48% to leave, is crucial to glean a better picture of what the nation hopes for as it removes formal political ties with the rest of Europe. From a party perspective, analyses into who Brexit voters are allows them to capitalise off underlying motivations to advance their political standing. For the incumbent government, a deeper understanding of what the nation voted for in 2016 central to negotiating a nationally palatable deal.</p>

<div id="change-in-predicted-probability-of-voting-leave-associated-with-each-individual-level-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>Change in Predicted Probability of Voting Leave Associated with Each Individual-Level Variable</h3>
<p>This plot reflects:</p>
<p><em>The Change in Predicted Probability of Voting Leave Associated with Each Individual-Level Variable, relative to the Control Voter in a randomly-selected Control Constituency. The Control Voter exhibits the following characteristics: Non-UKIP Voter (2015 Election), Female, Intermediate Education (Neither High nor Low). They occupy a randomly-selected constituency which has a median Percentage Conservative Vote, median Percentage White British population and median Percentage of Depravity (based on demographic data for all 631 constituencies).</em></p>
<p>Here I demonstrate the effect of individual-level variables on percentage likelihood of voting Leave. Each point shows the predicted change in probability of voting Leave associated with the variable level, ceteris paribus, relative to a Control Voter predicted to have a 49.8% probability of voting Leave. As expected, UKIP is most strongly associated with voting Leave, a UKIP voter being 49.0% more likely to vote Leave than the Control Voter. Being Male has the weakest 1.43% effect, increasing the probability of voting Leave, whilst having a university degree and having no education each result in a 14.8% and 3.19% lower probability of voting Leave, respectively. Thus, the uneducated and highly educated are both less likely to vote Leave than an individual with some education, though the educated are less likely to vote Leave than either lower education group. This ambiguity suggests a non-linear relationship, though education must be an ordinal variable for this effect to be fully understood.</p>
<p><strong>To delve deeper into the broader regional drivers of the Leave vote, I fix individual-level variables at specific profiles and compare predicted probabilities between constituency-level predictors…</strong></p>

<h3>Change in Predicted Probability of Voting Leave Associated with Each Constituency-Level Variable</h3>
<p>This plot reflects:</p>
<p><em>Change in Predicted Probability of Voting Leave Associated with Each Constituency-Level Variable (the Change in Predicted Probability of Voting Leave for a Fixed Voter, from occupying a randomly selected constituency with a Minimum observed Constituency-Level Percentage to a constituency with a Maximum observed Constituency-Level Percentage, ceteris paribus). Comparison is between constituency-level effects on the Control Voter (see Figure above), and 4 Profiles differing from the Control Voter in only 1 individual-level variable.</em></p>
<p>Evidently, the probability of voting Leave for voters with varying individual-level characteristics (based on a Control Voter) is affected differently by constituency-level variables. Higher percentages of Deprivation, Conservative Voters and White British Population all increase probability of voting Leave. The effect of each constituency-level variable is prominent, affecting voting tendencies at most (as maximum and minimum values are taken for a randomly-selected constituency) by 18.1%-31.5%: with deviation less than 4.00% across individuals of differing sex and education. For these profiles, Deprivation most increases probability of voting Leave: a voter being on average 31.0% more likely to vote Leave in a constituency with the highest depravity (30.8%) than one with minimum depravity (10.2%), with other constituency-level variables at their median. Of lower magnitude are Conservative Voting (28.8%) and White British Population (20.9%), though each have similarly large average effects.</p>
<p>Further, we find that being a UKIP voter almost entirely eliminates the effect of constituency-level variables: each affecting a UKIP voter’s probability of voting leave by less than 2.00%. Regardless of their constituency, UKIP voters are approximately equally likely to vote Leave, revealing that, though each constituency-level variable increases probability of voting Leave, the magnitude of their effect can depend heavily on individual-level characteristics.</p>
<p>Having identified such a strong relationship between voting for the UKIP party and voting Leave, I now explore how the party individuals vote for is related to their Brexit voting decisions. This requires a new dataset, of the cleaned Brexit result.</p>

<h2>Occam’s Razor</h2>
<p>It is evident that there is heterogeneity in constituency-level percentage Leave vote by party. Most evidently, our conclusions on the relationship between UKIP voting and Leave voting are ratified, since the Yellow UKIP points show the strongest positive correlation: higher constituency-level UKIP voting in 2015 was strongly related to higher constituency-level Leave voting in 2016. It is also clear that voting Liberal Democrat is not paticularly related to Leave or Remain voting: not only is the level of 2015 voting for the LibDems relatively constand and low compared to other parties, but the spread of Leave voting in these constituencies is extremely large. Contrastingly, both the proportion of 2015 votes received for the Labour and Conservative parties and the proportion of these constituencies that voted leave, vary widely. However, on average, it is clear that constituencies that voted for the Conservative party in 2015 were more strongly associated with higher percentage leave voting in 2016 than more Labour-voting constituencies.</p>
