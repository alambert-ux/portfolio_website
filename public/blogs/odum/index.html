<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>Santander Bikes (or “Boris Bikes”, in recognition of the then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson), are widely used across the City of London by tens of thousands of people every day. Understanding how many bikes are likely to be in use on a given day of the week, and a given month of the year is crucial for making decisions around how many bikes to provide, how often they need to be serviced, and make revenue and profitability forecasts crucial for informing future investment in “green” technologies and services in the City of London.</p>

<div id="an-interpretation" class="section level3">
<h3>An Interpretation</h3>
<p>Distribution of Bikes hired in the month of May and June in 2020 varies significantly from previous years. The standard deviation has increased as the curve looks flattened out. As a result the peak is not occurring at the usual value of around 40k bikes hired. This can be attributed to Lockdown measures put in place in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>This plot shows clearly how February-May 2020 marks a stark contrast to all previous years, due to Lockdown measures. Interestingly, there is also a substantial “rebound” from May to July as bike usage increases well over the long-term average expected level. It is interesting to see the difference between 2018 and 2019, too: 2018 experienced “the beast from the East”, a cold front that caused snow throughout February and March, which evidently depressed bike usage well below the long-term average. Contrastingly, 2019 experienced a moderate Spring. Less consistent is the fact that bike usage falls below the long-term expectation across Summer 2019, which included some of the hottest days on UK record. This indicates that both extreme heat and cold inhibit bike usage in London, a relationship which warrants further investigation</p>

<div id="an-interpretation-1" class="section level3">
<h3>An Interpretation</h3>
<p>Here, again, the impact of COVID-19 and the Spring 2020 Lockdown is evident. While in both 2017 and 2019 Week 13 was the highest peak in percentage change in bike usage across the whole year, in 2020 this same week was the trough, as Lockdown measures were imposed on the city.</p>
<p><strong>A Note on Long-Term Averages</strong></p>
<p>Expected rentals (weekly or monthly) are generated by averaging weekly or monthly averages of daily bike usage across the years surveyed. In this context, we have 6 averages for each week/month, across the period 2015-2020, which we average to calculate expectations. Given that each of these weekly/monthly averages is not substantially different across years, we have no major outliers in our data, which means that using the median to calculate expected rentals is not particularly beneficial.</p>
<p>In fact, we can expect that the average weekly/monthly rentals are normally distributed for a given week/month across years. i.e. if we plotted the weekly/monthly average daily bike usage for a given week/month for each of N years, we would find that the distribution of averages for each week/month would be normally distributed across all N years in our sample.</p>
<p>As such, the mean is the optimal measure, since the expected rentals is a function (cross-year average) of the weekly/monthly average of daily bike rentals, which we are (justifiably) assuming is normally distributed for each week/month across the years surveyed.</p>
</div>

<div id="occams-razor" class="section level2">
<h2>Occam’s Razor</h2>
<p>This brief analysis has demonstrated the dramatic effect of COVID-19 government-imposed measures on usage of communally accessible bikes in the City of London. There is significant scope for further analyses, specifically converting these insights into revenue estimates and forecasting losses incurred as a result of the crisis itself. However, for now these profitability considerations remain beyond the scope of my study.</p>
