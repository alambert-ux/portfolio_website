# Ambitions

I aspire to a career in strategic management and product development for social enterprise, in particular bringing together cutting-edge technology and analytics to advance healthcare and education worldwide. 

Whilst developing strategic research for Sana Labs, a growth-stage AI company with a vision of democratising personalised education, I began to understand the potential for analytics to create scalable, tangible change. By formulating mission and vision statements, articulating our project through a TED talk and communicating complex analytics to clients through proofs of concept and deep-dive frameworks, I experienced the impact our algorithms had on students worldwide. These experiences have allowed me not only to build analytically transparent models, but to articulate insights persuasively to successfully implement strategy. It was this robust foundation at the intersection of business strategy and mission-driven enterprise which inspired me to pursue a career in strategy, innovation and impact within multinational philanthropy.

Consequently, I endeavour to collaborate globally and innovatively to measurably improve lives, developing intelligent solutions to enduring humanitarian problems. I intend to achieve this by driving initiatives within the Strategy, Data and Analytics teams of established impact-first organisations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. 

Having obtained the necessary experience in international development, resource allocation and fundraising, I aspire to establish a venture philanthropy. By employing and allocating both human and financial capital to aid innovation, streamline management practices and aid sustainable growth, I intend to support the strategic objectives of social enterprise worldwide.
