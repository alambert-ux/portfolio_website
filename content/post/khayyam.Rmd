## Inspiration
My natural intellectual curiosity manifests itself creatively as well as professionally. I take pleasure both in mastering the pursuits I choose and sharing them with others. It is paradoxical that my longest standing hobbies are those I am unable to enjoy daily, such as dinghy sailing, yachting and classical guitar playing, which I maintain but rarely have the opportunity to develop further. 

## Balance 
My most “regular” activities are those which have established themselves as my daily routine. From my London home, I run most mornings through Regent’s Park to watch sunrise from Primrose Hill. The regularity of pace recalibrates and energises me. I meditate, employing visualisation to restore clarity to my approach and ground myself during the busyness of daily life. 

## Beauty
My greatest passions have become those which deepen the relationships I have with those around me, and can be enjoyed together. My interest in horology and design led me to broaden my reading and connect with industry players such as Audemars Piguet. Initially a diversified asset, my passion for art has grown considerably over the past few years. Aged eighteen I invested funds earnt through my work to purchase a David Yarrow limited print, having first read about him back in 2015, in a life-defining GQ article featuring prominent European hedge fund managers. Subsequently, I have expanded my collection to include a number of paintings by globally renowned hyperrealist, Mike Dargas. Developing a close relationship with Maddox Gallery and its artists, I enjoy the refreshing contrast between creative industry and traditional business – and have realised the two are far more aligned than one might imagine. 

Together with an inherent love for world travel, these endeavors culminate in rich conversation across cultures, and immediate personal connection predicated upon a shared respect for beauty. Each month I host a group of friends for dinner – my passion for gastronomy realised in precious moments of good conversation, music and food.
