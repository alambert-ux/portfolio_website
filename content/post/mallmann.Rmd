# Ambitions and Foundations

I aspire to bring together cutting-edge technology, analytics and design to build products which promote global development and human advancement. To this end I am pursuing a career in product management and deployment strategy for world-leading enterprise.

I began to understand the potential for analytics to create scalable, tangible change whilst developing strategic research for Sana Labs, a growth-stage AI company with a vision of democratising personalised education. By articulating our project through a TED talk and implementing our product through numerous proofs of concept, deep-dive frameworks, and deployments, I realised the impact our algorithms had on companies at a global scale. These experiences have empowered me not only to build analytically transparent models, but to articulate myself persuasively and effectively to design and implement successful business strategies. 

Combined with robust foundations in financial services, having conducted equity research on both the sell-side, for behemoth Goldman Sachs, and the buy-side, at prominent European hedge fund, Odey Asset Management, as well as economic theory, teaching Development Economics at University College London, I believe that I am well placed to realise product-market fit. 

Harnessing this breadth of experience across business strategy, analytics, finance, and economic theory, I endeavour to collaborate globally and innovatively to measurably improve lives, developing and proliferating intelligent solutions to enduring human problems.
