<h1>Ambitions and Foundations</h1>
<p>I aspire to bring together cutting-edge technology, analytics and design to build products which promote global development and human advancement. To this end I am pursuing a career in product management and deployment strategy for world-leading enterprise.</p>
<p>I began to understand the potential for analytics to create scalable, tangible change whilst developing strategic research for Sana Labs, a growth-stage AI company with a vision of democratising personalised education. By articulating our project through a TED talk and implementing our product through numerous proofs of concept, deep-dive frameworks, and deployments, I realised the impact our algorithms had on companies at a global scale. These experiences have empowered me not only to build analytically transparent models, but to articulate myself persuasively and effectively to design and implement successful business strategies.</p>
<p>Combined with robust foundations in financial services, having conducted equity research on both the sell-side, for behemoth Goldman Sachs, and the buy-side, at prominent European hedge fund, Odey Asset Management, as well as economic theory, teaching Development Economics at University College London, I believe that I am well placed to realise product-market fit.</p>
<p>Harnessing this breadth of experience across business strategy, analytics, finance, and economic theory, I endeavour to collaborate globally and innovatively to measurably improve lives, developing and proliferating intelligent solutions to enduring human problems.</p>
