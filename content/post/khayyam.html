<h1>The Story So Far…</h1>
<p>For a brief summary of my personal and professional experience, see my most recent <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12SyD72Co9dRg4MpBBCtA92TIyoUoLI9t/view?usp=sharing" title="Alberto Lambert - Curriculum Vitae">Curriculum Vitae</a></p>

<div id="ambitions-and-foundations" class="section level1">
<h1>Ambitions and Foundations</h1>
<p>I aspire to a career in product management and deployment strategy for world-leading enterprise, bringing together cutting-edge technology and analytics to promote global development and human advancement.</p>
<p>Whilst developing strategic research for Sana Labs, a growth-stage AI company with a vision of democratising personalised education, I began to understand the potential for analytics to create scalable, tangible change. By formulating mission and vision statements, articulating our project through a TED talk and communicating complex analytics to clients through numerous proofs of concept, deep-dive frameworks, and deployments, I realised the impact our algorithms had on companies at a global scale.</p>
<p>These experiences have empowered me not only to build analytically transparent models, but to articulate prescriptive insights persuasively to implement successful strategies. It is this insight, at the intersection of business strategy and mission-driven enterprise which inspired me to pursue a career in analytics-driven strategy, innovation and impact.</p>
<p>Combined with robust foundations in financial services, having conducted equity research on both the Sell-Side, for behemoth Goldman Sachs, and the Buy-Side, at prominent European hedge fund, Odey Asset Management, as well as economic theory, as a teacher of Development Economics and Econometrics at University College London, I believe that I am well placed to build successful, world-changing products.</p>
<p>Harnessing this breadth of experience across quantitative analytics, finance, business strategy and economic theory, I endeavour to collaborate globally and innovatively to measurably improve lives, developing and proliferating intelligent solutions to enduring humanitarian problems.</p>
