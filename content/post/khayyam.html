<h1>The Story So Far…</h1>
<p>For a brief summary of my personal and professional experience, see my most recent <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12SyD72Co9dRg4MpBBCtA92TIyoUoLI9t/view?usp=sharing" title="Alberto Lambert - Curriculum Vitae">Curriculum Vitae</a>.</p>

<h1>Ambitions and Foundations</h1>
<p>I aspire to a career in product management and deployment strategy for world-leading enterprise, bringing together cutting-edge technology and analytics to promote global development and human advancement.</p>
<p>Whilst developing strategic research for Sana Labs, a growth-stage AI company with a vision of democratising personalised education, I began to understand the potential for analytics to create scalable, tangible change. By articulating our project through a TED talk and sharing insights with clients through numerous proofs of concept, deep-dive frameworks, and deployments, I realised the impact our algorithms had on companies at a global scale. These experiences have empowered me not only to build analytically transparent models, but to articulate myself persuasively and effectively to implement successful product strategies.</p>
<p>Combined with robust foundations in financial services, having conducted equity research on both the Sell-Side, for behemoth Goldman Sachs, and the Buy-Side, at prominent European hedge fund, Odey Asset Management, as well as economic theory, as a teacher of Development Economics at University College London, I believe that I am well placed to build successful, world-changing products.</p>
<p>Harnessing this breadth of experience across analytics, finance, business strategy and economic theory, I endeavour to collaborate globally and innovatively to measurably improve lives, developing and proliferating intelligent solutions to enduring humanitarian problems.</p>
